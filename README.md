## **Cherish Everything - Billy Dunleavy**

My audio begins with a simple drive home from a family holiday, yet not everything can be as simple. An unexpected accident marks the main event change that provides meaning to the whole experience. All sounds prior setting the scene that happens in an instant. It is important to live in the moment, and to never take anything for granted, as one can never know what the next minute will bring.
